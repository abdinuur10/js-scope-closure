## Set Up The Project With Git 

**Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:**

* [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
* [ ] Add your group lead/instructor as collaborator on Github.
* [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Gabi's by mistake!).
* [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
* [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
* [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

**Follow these steps for completing your project.**

* [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into main (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
* [ ] Add your group lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
* [ ] Your group lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into main.

## Task 2: Scope and Closure

This task focuses on getting practice with scope and closures by asking you to write your own closure functions.

* [ ] Review the contents of the [scope_closure.js](scope_closure.js) file.
* [ ] Complete the problems provided to you but skip over stretch problems until you are complete with every other JS file first.

## Stretch Goals

* [ ] Go back through the stretch problems that you skipped over and complete as many as you can.
